# nebule-php
Code of nebule on PHP.
This is a hyper-graph database with some applications.

Do not work since PHP 7.3 .
Under full reconstruction for new links v2.
Many bugs for now...

To try :
  - install PHP with web serveur
  - put bootstrap.php as index.php on web server
  - and call it from a browser.
